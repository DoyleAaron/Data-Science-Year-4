    "#### Dataset & Model Overview\n",
    "- After getting a decent understanding of how a supervised neural network like the one I did in predicting wine quality with a FFNN, I wanted to try an unsupervised model.\n",
    "- I am using this dataset (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), this dataset is a subset of the 80 million tiny images dataset.\n",
    "- This dataset has 60,000 images with 10 classes and 6000 images per class.\n",
    "- I want this model to be able to correctly classify the class that the image belongs to.\n",
    "- I am planning to use a Self-Organising Map (SOM) for this as it is good for clustering an image detection which is the task at hand here.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Learnings & Findings\n",
    "- I am extracting the dataset in the way specified here (https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html)\n",
    "- I am going to try the SOM structure that I found here (https://modelzoo.co/model/som)"
