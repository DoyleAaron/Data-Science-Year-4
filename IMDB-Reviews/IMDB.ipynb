    "- Found the dataset that I want to use from this link (https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/dataset-for-sentiment-analysis/#1-imdb-reviews-dataset)\n",
    "- This is a sentiment analysis dataset taken from IMDB movie reviews and it is used to find out whether or not a review is positive or negative based on the words used in the reviews\n",
    "- It has 50,000 rows, this isn't the biggest dataset but it is a good starting point whilst getting used to the new model and I want to see how accurate I can get it at predicting sentiments\n",
    "- A multinomial Bayesian Classifier seems to be the best fit for this dataset as this will have a high number of features which multinomial bayesian classifiers are good at handling."
